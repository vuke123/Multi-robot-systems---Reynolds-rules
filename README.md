# Multi-robot-systems---Reynolds-rules

This paper presents the implementation and testing of swarm robotics behaviors using Reynolds rules in a simulated 2D environment. The study begins with the realization of basic Reynolds rules—separation, alignment, and cohesion—which enable robots to exhibit flocking behaviors inspired by natural phenomena such as bird flocks and fish schools. Further, additional rules are developed to extend the swarm's capabilities, including navigation towards a target and obstacle avoidance. The robots operate in a simulated environment using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and the Stage simulator, where different maps and parameters are employed to evaluate their performance. By varying environmental factors and rule parameters, the results provide insights into the scalability and adaptability of the swarm system. The findings contribute to advancements in multi-robot systems and autonomous navigation, offering practical insights for applications in dynamic and unpredictable environments.
